# _Basic Macbook Scraper Webpage for craigslist_

This webpage queries craigslist for macbooks then returns the macbooks in a table with title, price, location, condition, model, posted date, description and link.

This is a work in progress and proof of concept.

## To Run
In the console cd into home directory, run bundle, then run ruby app.rb. Open localhost:4567 in browser and search away.

If you want to change the query to your location, search your local craigslist for macbook and copy and paste the link into the search_link on line 15 of app.rb
